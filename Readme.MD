Online Learning Platform: Design a database to support an online learning platform, including user profiles, courses, and assessments.


## Executive Summary
The proposed database is designed to support an online learning platform that facilitates user engagement, course management, and assessment tracking. The platform aims to provide a seamless learning experience for users while offering comprehensive tools for instructors and administrators to manage content and monitor progress effectively.


## Specifications
 
Courses Collection
_id: Unique identifier 
title: Title of the course
description: Description of the course
duration: Duration of the course

Users Collection:

Data Validation:
Email validation for user registration.
Password hashing for security.
Deadline validation for assessments to ensure submissions are within the deadline.
Unique constraints for usernames, email addresses, course titles, etc., to prevent duplicates.
Relationships:

Users can enroll in multiple courses (many-to-many relationship between Users and Courses).
Courses have multiple modules, and each module has multiple lessons (one-to-many relationship between Courses, Modules, and Lessons).
Courses and assessments are related, with each assessment belonging to a specific course (one-to-many relationship between Courses and Assessments).
Users can submit multiple assessments, and each assessment can have multiple submissions (one-to-many relationship between Users, Assessments, and Submissions).


## Conclusion
The designed database for the online learning platform provides a robust foundation for managing user interactions, course content, and assessment processes. With its scalable and flexible architecture, the platform can scale seamlessly while delivering a rich and engaging learning environment for users.
